A tiny script to make cute circular cutouts of pictures.

ChatGPT prompt: 

"make a python script that takes every picture in folder img and if a face is detected would reformat to 100 x 100 px and make a circular cutout with a white background"

To run this script, you need to install `opencv-python` and `pillow` if you haven't already. You can install these using pip:

The  script assumes the existence of a 'result' folder inside the 'img' folder, where all processed images are stored.

``pip install opencv-python pillow``
